## Description 

**Migrate or Backup Settings**
Finally, not only do backups or transfers of Genesis core settings but **also hook in official & third-party plugins** plus **some child themes**. Especially useful for site builders and developers to speed up their work!

[**original video link**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5c-lemjFxSs) *by plugin developer David Decker*

A great helper tool for Genesis child themes plus Genesis-specific plugins with their own **extra settings**!

**Please note:** The plugin requires the *Genesis Framework*, a paid premium product released by StudioPress/ WPEngine, Inc. [(via studiopress.com)](https://deckerweb.de/go/genesis/)


### What the Plugin does? 
* Currently 31 different plugins are supported. (These being official ones plus third-party community plugins.)
* Currently 62 different child themes with extra settings are supported. (These being all third-party child themes sold or downloadable via "StudioPress Community Marketplace" *or* elsewhere.)
* Settings export for the first time possible for a lot of these plugins and/ or child themes!
* Combined settings .JSON file, speeds up development especially!
* Seperate plugin settings .JSON files could be useful for testing purposes for developers etc.
* New plugins and child themes may be added, that support the Genesis Settings Field/ API!
* Also, plugins and child themes that natively hook in to the Genesis Exporter themselves may be removed from support here (to avoid doubled items!).
* Fully internationalized plugin, fully transalateable.
* This plugin just leverages the AWESOMENESS of Genesis Framework and WordPress! Therefore it's a really simple, lightweight, flexible plugin.

See the *FAQ* here for a [**full list of supported plugins & child themes...**](https://wordpress.org/plugins/genesis-extra-settings-transporter/#faq)


### Useful for: 
* Users who want to backup their settings - in a combined way, or seperate for supported plugins and/ or themes.
* Developers and/ or agencies who want to speed up their development times and just use pure Genesis awesomeness :).

**Typical Workflow Example**
*Transfer settings from a development install to the live/ production install.*

**1) Prerequisites/ Requirements:**

* On BOTH sites/ installations you have installed & activated for example the (great) "Curtail" child theme, plus the following plugins: Genesis Layout Extras, Genesis Responsive Slider, Genesis Simple Hooks, Genesis Simple Sidebars.
* On BOTH sites/ installations you have installed & activated this plugin, "Genesis Extra Settings Transporter".
* It's recommended to have THE VERY SAME VERSIONS installed on the original site and also the receiving site. Reason: sometimes settings differ between plugin or child theme versions. So with making sure you have the same versions installed you just ensure the correct settings are included within the export file.

**2) Transfer (Migrate):**

* On the development install: Just make an Export file via **Genesis > Import/Export** admin page:
* In the "Export" section there enable all checkboxes you need.
* Save the resulting `.JSON` file to your computer.
* On the live/ production site, just import this `.JSON` file and you're done! ;-)

1. Install using the WordPress built-in Plugin installer (via **Plugins > Add New** - search for `genesis extra settings transporter`), or extract the ZIP file and drop the contents in the `wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress installation.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

## Frequently Asked Questions 


### What's the recommended usage of this plugin? 
[Just see plugin's page (you are on it right now)](https://wordpress.org/plugins/genesis-extra-settings-transporter/) for a typical workflow example.



### "Genesis Simple Sidebars" plugin: Why are inpost/ inpage settings not included? 
Good question, hehe :). Simple answer: not possible as these settings belong to the actual post meta. You can always import & export all posts/ pages/ custom post types via the NATIVE WORDPRESS export and import functionality. This applies for any inpost/ inpage/ CPT post meta settings in WordPress generally. All administrator users have access to "Tools" in the left-hand admin menu and could do exports and imports.



### Why are Widget settings not included? 
That's just not possible yet. Still, there is no such functionality in WordPress core as is in Genesis yet! However, there's a nice third-party plugin for that purpose: ["Widget Importer & Exporter"](https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-importer-exporter/)



### Why isn't plugin/ child theme X,Y not supported? 
I can only support plugins and child themes that make use of the WordPress/ Genesis settings API and use a settings field other than that from Genesis itself. Will more developers add this to their work I could add support in this helper plugin. It's as simple as that :).

The way better alternative, though, is, when developers add that little hook in to the Genesis Exporter **natively**! In this case I might remove support here for such a plugin/ child theme, of course.

Also note, some plugins have 1 or 2 little settings included in Genesis Theme Settings, therefore THESE settings are then included in the default, native Genesis export file. So you'll already have these safe for your exports and imports as well.



### What's up with the Prose child theme? 
"Prose" natively includes its settings on the Genesis exporter page, so you're already hooked up! You can export and import all "Design Settings" at any time!



### Some settings seem not to be included, what should I do? 
Just make sure you have the very same versions of the plugins or child themes installed. If you have a development and live install, just make sure, both have "Genesis Simple Hooks, version 1.8.0.2" installed, to name an example. -- Reason: Sometimes setting field names could differ between different versions, or settings may be added or removed in newer/ older versions.



### Hands down, how does it all work? 
Just to clarify: This plugin here does NO export/ import ON ITS OWN! It just hooks in to the existing Genesis Exporter feature and leverages existing Genesis & WordPress functionality :).

### More info on Translations? 

* English - default, always included
* German (de_DE): Deutsch - immer dabei! :-)
* For custom and update-safe language files please upload them to `/wp-content/languages/genesis-extra-settings-transporter/` (just create this folder) - This enables you to use fully custom translations that won't be overridden on plugin updates. Also, complete custom English wording is possible with that as well, just use a language file like `genesis-extra-settings-transporter-en_US.mo/.po` to achieve that (for creating one see the following tools).

**Easy WordPress.org plugin translation platform with GlotPress platform:** [**Translate "Builder Template Categories"...**](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/genesis-extra-settings-transporter)

*Note:* All my plugins are internationalized/ translateable by default. This is very important for all users worldwide. So please contribute your language to the plugin to make it even more useful. For translating and validating I recommend the awesome ["Poedit Editor"](https://www.poedit.net/), which works fine on Windows, macOS and Linux.



### Idea Behind this plugin, its philosophy? 
Exporting and importing settings for plugins like "Genesis Simple Hooks" or my own "Genesis Layout Extras" plugin was always a "nice to have". Now, that I've found out Genesis had a filter for that - thanks to Genesis developer [Gary Jones](https://garyjones.io/)! - I just created this plugin. It's a small tool I need and use myself. My hope is that it may help other users and developers as well! :) ENJOY!
